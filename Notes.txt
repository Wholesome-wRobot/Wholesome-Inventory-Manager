for a warlock dmg stat is worth checking only for wands and not for other weapons like daggers, 
staves etc. Same for let's say rogue - dmg for main hand and off hand weapon matters alot 
but not for bows, crossbows, thrown weapons.

some characters like shaman enhancement can wield 2h weapons (and should be) but 
after lvl 40 he should switch to 2x 1hand and leave the 2h completely. 
Same for fury warrior: untill lvl 60 you want to wield a 2h weapon or 2x 1h 
weapons but after lvl 60 you should use only 2x 2h weapons


Also shields for shamans - armor doesnt matter for them tbh but only intellect, 
spirit, spell power etc... But for paladin prot it can be much more 
different where the block and the armor can matters

Swords doesn't work for
Paladin
DK
Hunter
